Louvain Method for Community Detection and Verification Methods (C Programming Language)


The listed code (Louvain_code) implements the grouping of components that compose networks and, therefore, graphs using Louvain Method.
The Louvain method processes graphs, ie files containing nodes, edges, and a degree of similarity in weight

The Evaluators_Code file contains the code that can be used to evaluate successful grouping.
It can also be used to find common sequences that result from a clustering method.
The code implements and uses the following external evaluation methods
Rand Index
Jaccard Index

The basis of the verification is the data of the grouping. Each user can modify the code appropriately
to compare his or her elements with a ground truth. Moreover compairing the elements or sequences to each other is possible 
( when no ground truth is available).

Caution: The Jaccard Index is a totally reliable index, by using the intersection and union  mathematical attributes.
Rand Index may give wrong figures if the results and groups compared are not the same size, not
are aligned and repetitive.
